# Orange-Cosmos-Roleplay
An updated version of the old Garry's Mod gamemode

This was a Lua learning project for me. As such, do not expect perfection. Issues are definitely present, but if you report them I'll do my best to fix. I didn't intend initially to release this, but I don't have the time to run it on a server and it feels a waste not to share.

Requires:
* VCMod
* VCMod ELS
* ULX
* ULib
* OCRP Content Pack
* MySQL Database

Recommended:
* Atmos Weather
* Some anticheat
